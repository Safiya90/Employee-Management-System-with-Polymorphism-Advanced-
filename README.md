# Employee Management System with Polymorphism (Advanced)

Concepts Used: Inheritance, polymorphism, constructor chaining, overriding, base class logic
Description:
Create a base class Employee:
- Name, Salary
- Method: CalculateBonus() — returns 10% of salary
Create 2 derived classes:
- Manager → 20% bonus
- Developer → 15% bonus
Create an HR class that takes a list of employees and prints their bonuses using polymorphism.
Extra:
- Use constructor chaining (base keyword)
- Validate salary is non-negativ
